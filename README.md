# 🏢 Employee Expense Reimbursement Fraud Detection  
**Developed by Ashwini Krishnan | Machine Learning Project 2025**

</div>

---

## 1. Overview  
This project is an **AI-driven internal audit system** designed to detect potential fraud in employee expense reimbursement claims.  
It leverages advanced machine learning (**CatBoost**) models, a corporate-grade **Streamlit executive dashboard**, and automated **PDF reporting** to strengthen financial governance and compliance.

The system provides:  
- Intelligent fraud probability prediction using structured expense features.  
- Real-time executive dashboard for claim analysis and insights.  
- Confidence-based model interpretation with key contributing factors.  
- Auto-generated, professional-grade PDF audit reports.

## 2. Business Context  
Organizations process thousands of employee reimbursement claims every month. Manual reviews are often inconsistent, subjective, and time-consuming.  
This project automates claim verification by flagging anomalies such as **inflated expenses**, **missing receipts**, and **unusual approval ratios**, helping finance departments maintain transparency and operational integrity.

## 3. Key Features  
- **Executive Streamlit Dashboard** — professional corporate UI for financial analysis.  
- **AI-Powered Fraud Detection** — built on CatBoost ensemble classification model.  
- **Advanced Analytics Expander** — interpretable AI insights for decision makers.  
- **Automated PDF Audit Reports** — generates single-page audit-grade summaries.  
- **Dataset & Model Overview** — togglable transparency section for reviewers.
